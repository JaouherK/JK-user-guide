# A User Guide To Working With Jaouher K.

It's a pleasure and an exciting opportunity to collaborate with you. I firmly believe that our unique experiences shape our perspectives and approaches to work, leading to a rich diversity of thoughts and strategies.

Inspired by an insightful article I read (you can find it [here](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to)), I decided to create this manual. It's meant to shed light on my work style, values, problem-solving tactics, blind spots, and trust-building strategies. My hope is that this guide fosters clearer, more effective collaboration as we embark on this journey together.

## How I View Success
- To me, success is a journey where both the outcome and the process hold equal importance.
- A good team cares for each other, feels proud to be part of it, and finds work fun and challenging.
- It's okay to make mistakes – they're like unexpected plot twists in a movie. But we should learn from them and commit to do better next time, like a sequel that outshines the original!

## How I Communicate

- I might get caught up in my thoughts when speaking, like a squirrel in a nut factory. Please, always feel free to ask for clarifications or specific action items.
- Your challenges to my ideas or arguments are not just welcome, but encouraged.
- I'm continually refining my communication methods, especially in providing feedback. If my style doesn't align with your preferences, I’m open to adapting.
- I like talking in person or through voice messages more than texts or emails.
- Should I forget to follow up, a gentle reminder from you would be as welcome as a lifeboat on a sinking ship. Greatly appreciated, indeed!
- I'm always open to discussions, be they technical, professional, or personal. If I'm not the best person to help, I will direct you to a smarter person that can help you solve your problem.

## Things I Do That Might Bother You

- I occasionally run late for meetings. A quick reminder would be helpful to get me on track.
- I sometimes use swear words. If you feel like my way does not fit your style or believes, let me know.
- I might give the impression that I am insensitive or that I do not trust others. A conversation can usually clear up these misinterpretations.

## Factors That Influence My Positive and Negative Views

- I admire people who do their best, aim always for high-quality and are honest about what's going well and what's not. 
- I like people who keep learning and admit their weaknesses.
- I admire those who take full ownership of problems. I am impressed when someone goes out of his way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal (including me) to overcome challenges in their path.
- Dependence on others to resolve issues without taking initiative is like expecting a pizza to order itself – unlikely and a bit of a letdown. Please don't.
- Presenting an overly rosy picture or denying room for improvement raises my skepticism.

## My strengths
- *Long-term focus*: I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I'd like things to be in the future and lots of ideas on how we might get there.
- *Educator and Learner*: Sharing knowledge is something I cherish, and I'm equally enthusiastic about learning from others, regardless of their position or expertise. I also seek empirical evidence through proofs of concept, prototypes, and external research.

## My growth areas

- *Clarity and Simplicity in Communication*: I'm honing my skills to communicate more directly and simply, especially with individuals of varying technical backgrounds.

## How I give and receive feedback
- I actively seek out feedback like a detective on a mystery case, and welcome it in real-time to solve the puzzle of self-improvement.
- My goal is to offer constructive feedback like a friendly coach – always aiming to help and inspire, benefiting those who might gain from my perspective.
