# A User Guide To Working With Jaouher Kh.

It is a pleasure to work with you, and I am looking forward to all the challenges we are going to face as brothers in arms. Every human personality is shaped by his past experiences which leads different views and conceptions on how we like to work.

I read a nice article [somewhere](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-a-user-guide-to) That made me decide to create this How-To manual. It creates clarity on how I work, what I value, how I look at problems, what my blind spots are, and how to build trust with you. I believe this will lead to better and clearer collaborations during our joint journey.

## How I view success
- Success for me is a journey. The result and the process are both my criteria to define a successful outcome
- A successful team for me is a team that: Cares for each other, everyone is proud to be part of it, working is both fun and challenging
- We can always improve as long as we identify what needs to be improved next time

## How I communicate

- Sometimes I get dragged in my thoughts when I talk out loud. Please feel free to always ask for clarifications or action items any time.
- If you feel that my arguments are vague or simply wrong please don't think twice about challenging them.
- I am working on my methods of communicating especially on providing ideas, concerns or simply feedback. If you feel that my approach does not fit your personality, please let me know. 
- I prefer in-person or voice messages over chat and email communication. I will try regardless to get back to ASAP.
- It might happen that I forget to follow up, please feel free to ping me in order to remediate to my lack of attention.
- If you have either a technical or professional or even a personal topic to talk about, I am always available to assist as much as I can or at least to direct you to a smarter person. 

## Things I do that may annoy you
What’s the cause of misunderstandings that you’ve had in the past? What are some things about your style that other people have given you critical feedback on? What quirks or mannerisms might unintentionally annoy a different personality type?

- It happens that I am late to meetings, sometimes for unexpected reasons. Please ping me so I can join you ASAP.
- I sometimes use swear words. If you feel like my way does not fit your style or believes, let me know.
- I might give the impression that I am insensitive or that I do not trust others. Usually, there is a misunderstanding somewhere that needs to be solved. I am happy to sit with you to resolve it fast.


## What gains and loses my trust

- The easiest way to win my trust is to care about getting high-quality outcomes and to be transparent about what you think is going well or not well. I admire people with keen self-awareness, who are constantly looking to learn, and who admit their challenges and growth areas. I also admire people who go out of their way to ask others for feedback
- Another thing that builds my trust is extreme ownership of a problem. I am impressed when someone goes out of his way not just to identify a problem, but to rally the right people and processes in solving it. I love it when people use all the resources at their disposal—including me!—to overcome challenges in their path. my trust is lost with those who frequently act like victims and who complain about problems and expect them to be solved by others.
- I am suspicious of those trying to sell me a narrative that everything is perfect, or that there is nothing they could have done any better

## My strengths
- *Long-term focus*: I think long-term when it comes to prioritizing people, processes, and strategy. I generally have a clear vision of where I'd like things to be in the future, and lots of ideas on how we might get there.
- *A teacher and a Student*: I enjoy teaching and relaying my knowledge to whoever asks for it. I also see no shame on approaching anyone and ask him for assistance or a piece of advice. I also seek empirical evidence through proofs of concept, prototypes and external research.

## My growth areas

- *Directness and simplicity in communication*: I am working on cutting through the noise, and closing the gap between what I want to express and what others hear. I'd like to get better at quickly diving into the heart of complex issues and turning them into principled frameworks. I also am working on my communication skills with people who are at a different technical level than me.

## How I give and receive feedback
- I am actively looking for feedback. Please feel free to share them with me in the spot to optimize the benefit from it. 
- I try to provide feedback from my end to everyone who I deem could benefit from my advice
